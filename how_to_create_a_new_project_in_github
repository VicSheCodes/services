How to push your local project to an existing GitHub repository (cmd.exe commands)

Checklist
- Initialize a local git repo (if not already)
- Add a sensible .gitignore
- Make an initial commit
- Add remote `origin` pointing to your GitHub repo
- Push to `main` (or merge remote if it already has commits)
- Verify on GitHub

Assumptions
- Your project path is C:\Users\victoria.gur\temp\services — replace if different.
- You have Git installed (run `git --version`). If not, install Git for Windows.

Commands to run in cmd.exe

1) Change to your project directory
cd /d C:\Users\victoria.gur\temp\services

2) (Optional) Initialize git if you haven't already
git init

3) Create a minimal .gitignore (optional but recommended). On Windows cmd, you can use echo:
echo __pycache__/> .gitignore
echo *.pyc>> .gitignore
echo .env>> .gitignore
echo venv/>> .gitignore
echo .idea/>> .gitignore

(You can edit .gitignore later with notepad .gitignore)

4) Stage and commit your files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

5) Add the remote `origin` (replace with your repo URL)
# If you created a repo named 'services' under https://github.com/VicSheCodes
git remote add origin https://github.com/VicSheCodes/services.git

# Or use SSH if you have SSH keys set up
# git remote add origin git@github.com:VicSheCodes/services.git

6) Rename local branch to `main` (modern default) and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Notes about authentication
- On the first push, Git will ask for credentials. For HTTPS, GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password. When prompted, use your GitHub username and the PAT as the password.
- To store credentials so you don't have to enter them every time:
  git config --global credential.helper manager-core
- If you prefer SSH: generate an SSH key (ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"), add the public key to your GitHub account, then use the SSH remote URL.

If the remote already has commits (e.g., README) — safe merge flow
If the remote repo is not empty, pushing may fail. Use this safe sequence to fetch and integrate remote changes:

git fetch origin
git branch -M main
git pull origin main --rebase
# If there are conflicts, resolve them, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue   # if you used rebase
# or if you merged: git commit

git push -u origin main

If Git says `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` (histories differ):

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# resolve conflicts, commit, then:
git push -u origin main

If `origin` already exists and you need to change it

git remote -v
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/VicSheCodes/services.git

Or simply update the URL without removing:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/VicSheCodes/services.git

If you want to overwrite the remote (danger — this will replace remote history):

git push -u origin main --force
# Only use --force if you really intend to replace the remote.

Alternative (safest when remote has files you want to keep)
- Clone the remote into a new folder, copy your files in, then commit & push:

cd /d C:\Users\victoria.gur\temp
git clone https://github.com/VicSheCodes/services.git cloned-repo
robocopy "C:\Users\victoria.gur\temp\services" "C:\Users\victoria.gur\temp\cloned-repo" /E /XD .git
cd cloned-repo
git add .
git commit -m "Add project files"
git push

Helpful status/check commands

git status
git remote -v
git branch -vv
git log --oneline --graph -n 20

Common errors & quick fixes
- "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" → consider `--allow-unrelated-histories` or use the clone-and-copy workflow.
- "error: failed to push some refs" / non-fast-forward → run `git pull --rebase origin main` then `git push`.
- Authentication failed → use a PAT or set up SSH keys, and enable credential manager.
- Large files causing push to fail → consider Git LFS.

Verify
- After push, open https://github.com/VicSheCodes/services and confirm files show up.
- Or run:

git remote -v
git branch -vv

Questions / next steps
- If you created a different repo name under your GitHub account, replace `services.git` above with the actual repo URL.
- If you want, I can paste exact commands for your repo name, or walk you through generating a PAT or SSH key.
